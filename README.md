# IT8951-E-Ink-Controller-STM32-Driver

The example is a project setup in the STM32CubeIDE using an STM32 NUCLEO-F401RE board. The board interfaced with the IT8951 E-Ink Controller that comes with the Waveshare 6inch HD e-Paper HAT E-ink Display. Two ADC channels were also configured to get a cursor position reading based off of potentiometer positions.
